### ReferEase 

Automating Referral Requests for Job Applications

### Problem Statement

Applying to jobs as a fresher is often a tiring and never-ending process. While you can apply through career portals, your resume might never reach the HR’s table due to the large volume of applicants.

In such scenarios, getting a referral becomes crucial. However, the process of reaching out for referrals is not simple:

You need to connect with 30+ professionals to maximize your chances.

Many people on LinkedIn are inactive.

Some have exhausted their referral limits.

Others may simply ignore your request due to their busy schedules.

This makes it important to send referral requests to as many employees as possible—which is a repetitive and time-consuming task.
